Tell Me A Joke
This is a simple web app that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to tell random jokes to the user. It makes use of the official JokeAPI to fetch joke data, and displays it on the page using DOM manipulation.

How to use
To use this app, simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser (such as Chrome or Firefox). You should see a button labeled "Tell me a joke!". Clicking on this button will trigger an API call to fetch a new random joke, and display it on the page.

You can click the button as many times as you like to get different jokes. There are different categories of jokes available, including programming, miscellaneous, dark, etc. You can customize the app to display only jokes from certain categories by modifying the GET request URL in the getJoke() function in script.js.
